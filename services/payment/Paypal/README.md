## Paypal Payments

**Procedure to send money via Paypal, and calculate the fees to be included in the amount you transfer.**

1) To calculate the fees, head over to [https://smallseotools.com/paypal-fee-calculator/](https://smallseotools.com/paypal-fee-calculator/) and find the section as shown in the below image. This is the best Paypal calculator I've found so far. Others either calculate lower or higher fees because they don't give flexibility to choose the Fee Rate.

2) Enter the amount in USD, in this case $1000, and select the Fee Rate as 6.5% + $0.05 USD and click on Calculate. This is the fee rate for international payments. You can learn more from the dropdown menu. If the calculator is not working, you can contact Pradumna.

3) After you click on Calculate, you will see the amount to send where it says "You should ask for," in this case, $1069.57 USD. This is the amount you should send. The amount I will receive is $1000 USD.
