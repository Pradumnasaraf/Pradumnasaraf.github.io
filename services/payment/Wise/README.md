## Wise Payments

**Procedure to send money to me in INR via Wise, ensuring all fees are included in the amount you transfer.**

1) After clicking on the "Send Money" option in Wise, select the recipient currency as INR. By doing so, my account details will appear in the subsequent step. This is because my Indian account can receive payments in INR. While you're free to choose any sending currency, please ensure that you select INR as the recipient currency. If you select any other currency, my account details will not appear in the subsequent step.

2) To include all the fees, add the "Total fees" amount to the amount you want to send and keep adjusting the amount until the "Total amount we'll convert" is equal to the amount you want to send. This is because the "Total amount we'll convert" is the amount that will be received by me. The "Total fees" is the amount that Wise will charge you for the transfer.

3) In the following step, enter the recipient's email address (Email may differ from the one shown confirm before proceeding). As soon as you input the email, the recipient's account details should appear under the "On Wise" section. Click on that to proceed to the next step. If they don't, please revisit the first step to ensure you selected the recipient currency as INR.
