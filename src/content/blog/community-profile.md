The community profile help grows the community and supports contributors.

A project includes recommended community health files, such as `README`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `LICENSE`, etc in a supported location.

## Checklist elements:

### ✅ README

It gives users a detailed description of a project. It can also be described as documentation with guidelines on how to use a project. Usually, it will have instructions on how to install and run the project.

### ✅ Code of conduct

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions.

### ✅ Contributing Guidelines

It helps new contributors to understand the whole process of the contribution to that project. It saves time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.

### ✅ Issue templates & Pull request template

Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository.

### ✅ LICENCE

license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software. Every license has its own protocols.
