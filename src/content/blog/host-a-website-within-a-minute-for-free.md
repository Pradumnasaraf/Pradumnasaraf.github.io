GitHub Pages is a static website hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub optionally runs the files through a build process and publishes a website.

## Let's now get straight into the process.

![Image description](/blog-images/host-a-website-within-a-minute-for-free/image-description-1.gif)

#### Step-1 : Creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/),

If you already have, you can skip this step.

#### Step-2 : Creating a GitHub Repo.

Create a new public repository and named it as `<Your-username>.github.io`,(as shown in the image below). If it's an organization account, then put the organization name. After that commit it.

#### Step-3 : Adding a `index.html` file.

After the repo is created, now it's time to add the index file. You will get served with this kind of screen after you committed the repo, click on **creating a new file**. Also, you can head over to the repo main page for creating the file.

Name the file `index.html`(shown in the image below) and add some starter HTML code (You can use the sample code below).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	     <title>Pradumna Saraf</title>
	</head>
	<body>

	     <h1>Website in One Minute</h1>
	     <p>We Did it :)</p>

	</body>
</html>
```

After adding the starter code, scroll down and commit those changes.

### WOOHOO 🎉, It's done, your website is hosted at .github.io, in my case [pradumnasaraf.github.io](https://pradumnasaraf.github.io)

**Note: if your website is not visible, no need to worry, wait 1-2 minutes and then try again because sometimes deployment takes time:D.**
