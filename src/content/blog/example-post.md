Welcome to my personal blog! This is an example post to show you how blog posts work on this site.

## Getting Started

You can create new blog posts by adding markdown files in the `src/content/blog` directory. Each post should start with frontmatter (the metadata between the `---` lines).

## Frontmatter Fields

- `title`: The title of your blog post
- `excerpt`: A short description/excerpt for the listing page
- `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `author`: Author name
- `category`: Category (e.g., Development, DevOps, Docker, etc.)
- `tags`: Array of tags
- `thumbnail`: Path to thumbnail image (e.g., `/media/image.png` or external URL)
- `draft`: Set to `true` to hide from listings (optional, defaults to false)

## Writing Content

Just write markdown below the frontmatter! All standard markdown features are supported.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
const example = 'This is a code block';
console.log(example);
```

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Images

You can reference images from your `public` directory or use external URLs.

That's it! Start creating your blog posts now.
