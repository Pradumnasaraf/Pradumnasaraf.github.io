It's a web hosting facility for the source code of the software, documentation, web pages, and other works. They are often used in open-source software projects.

## Why code hosting platform?

▪️ Collaboration - Many developers can develop/use a single project at a time.

▪️ Docs - Docs - Provide a place to document our work, without docs every project is incomplete.

▪️ Integration - Provides direct integration and workflow to make production easy.

## Some more preferred platforms:

▪️ Bitbucket

▪️ Gitlab

▪️ GitHub
