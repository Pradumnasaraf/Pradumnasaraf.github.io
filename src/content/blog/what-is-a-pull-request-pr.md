Requesting your changes to get added into the original/main repo.

We made changes on Fork and then create a PR from our branch to the main repo.

▶️Changes can be of any type:

▪️Code

▪️Documentation

▪️Design, etc.


## Firstly what is Fork?

The fork is making a copy of a repository. So that you can experiment without affecting the original repo.

We can't directly make changes to the others repo, we need to fork it, make changes, and then request them to add those changes to the original.

FORK ➡️ CHANGES ➡️ REQUEST.

## Creating a Fork:

Steps:

0) Go on the Repo you want to Fork.

1) Click on the Fork button in the top right corner.

2) Select an account (select account will only pop up if you have an Org account included.)
