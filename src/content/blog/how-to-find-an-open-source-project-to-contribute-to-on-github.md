New folks often find difficulty while finding **Open Source** projects to contribute to. Yes, sometimes it's overwhelming when we see some big organization/large-scale projects.

But we do not always need to start with bulky projects. We should always start with the project in which we are comfortable and level up on the way.

## Here are some ways to find

### 1) Issue tab in GitHub

Head over to the Issue tab in GitHub and the search box, type:

```yaml
label:"good first issue" language:java
```

(change the language para accordingly.)
