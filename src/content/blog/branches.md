A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project.

In simple words, with branches, we a taking a copy of the code to work and experiment, inside a repo, so that we don't disturb the mainline.

## Why do we need branches?

▪️ Develop new features.

▪️ Safely experiment with new ideas

▪️ Fixing bugs.

📌By default the project is on the main or master branch, depending on the project setting.

## Creating a Branch.

The branch can be created on our projects or the projects we have Forked.


## Good practices:

▪️ Try to give a proper name to a Branch.

▪️ Always try to create a branch with the latest commit.

▪️ While contributing to a project, firstly create a branch from the main/master branch and then work on it.

▪️ Delete the merged branches.

## "The only repo you need"

Aim: To build a GitHub repo and to bring all Bootcamp tweets and materials in one place, which will help the new learners in the future.
