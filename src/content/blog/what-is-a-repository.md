A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, README, images, videos, spreadsheets, and anything your project needs.

## Creating a repository (GitHub)

For ease, I made a graphic, on how to create a Repo from scratch.

## General elements a repo should contain:
(Some are already present)

▪️ LICENSE
▪️ Contributing guidelines
▪️ Forks
▪️ Releases
▪️ Issues & Pull Requests

After creating a new repo, it will look something like this.👇

▶️ **LICENSE**

An open-source license defines rules. for how a repo is modified, shared, and used.

▶️ **Contributing guidelines**

It's a file present in the repo with a short guide to how they can help with your project and contribute to it.

▶️ **Forks**

Shows the number of people who have made a copy of a repository.

▶️ **Releases & Packages**

Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

▶️ **Issues**

Issues let you track your work on GitHub, also, we can raise if we find any bug or any improvement needed in that project.

▶️ **Pull Requests**

Requesting for changes committed to an external repository.
